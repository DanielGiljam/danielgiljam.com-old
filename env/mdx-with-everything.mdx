This MDX file should contain all kinds of syntax. Paragraphs, blockquotes, lists, tables, you name it! Let's start off with a paragraph containing pointless text. You are reading that very paragraph as of right now. Next comes a [link to this repository](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/danielgiljam.com "github.com/DanielGiljam/danielgiljam.com").

Then comes a `h2`. Oh, and before the `h2` comes some `inlineCode` as well.

## The `h2`

So you just witnessed a `h2`. Did you like what you saw? If not, maybe you'll like the level 3 heading? Or possibly the level 4 heading?

### Tangent on Headings

_Headings_, _headlines_ or _titles_? What should you call them? I think it easily comes down to either _headings_ or _titles_, since _headlines_ kind of suggests a traditional newspapers context at least in my ears.

#### Trying out Bold text

So what does bold text look like? **Now** we know.

##### Dividers

Let's play around dividers.

---

Very divided indeed.

Blockquote looks nice? **_Doesn't it?_**

---

Very thematically broken indeed.

###### The Final Heading

Probably barely looks like a heading. ðŸ™„ (Did the emoji render well? ðŸ˜…)

## Back to 2nd Level

Run this in your shell:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
take new-project
git init
```

After this you should probably make a `.gitignore` file and commit it together with a license and a readme before you do anything else.

Then the next steps would be:

1. Create a `package.json`.
   - I usually copy one from the previous project I worked on, which has all the author, license and additional information already set the way I want them.
   - You can also let `npm` do it for you:
     ```bash
     npm init -y # Creates a very basic `package.json`.
     ```
2. Install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
3. Write some TypeScript code:

   ```typescript
   import {promises as fs} from "fs"
   import {resolve} from "path"

   import {transform} from "@babel/core"
   import mdx from "@mdx-js/mdx"
   import {MDXProvider, mdx as createElement} from "@mdx-js/react"
   import {GetStaticProps} from "next"
   import React from "react"
   import {renderToStaticMarkup} from "react-dom/server"

   import components from "../theme/mdx-components"

   interface MDXTestPageProps {
     mdxTest: string
   }

   export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<MDXTestPageProps> = async (
     context,
   ) => {
     const jsx = await mdx(
       (
         await fs.readFile(
           resolve(process.cwd(), "env/mdx-with-everything.mdx"),
           "utf-8",
         )
       ).replace(/<br>/g, "<br/>"),
       {
         skipExport: true,
       },
     )
     const code = transform(jsx, {
       plugins: ["@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx"],
     }).code
     const scope = {mdx: createElement}
     // eslint-disable-next-line
     const fn = new Function(
       "React",
       ...Object.keys(scope),
       `${code}; return React.createElement(MDXContent)`,
     )
     const element = fn(React, ...Object.values(scope))
     const elementWithProvider = React.createElement(
       MDXProvider,
       {components},
       element,
     )
     const mdxTest = renderToStaticMarkup(elementWithProvider)
     return {props: {mdxTest}}
   }
   ```

## It's Time For a Table

| Items | Weight | Amount |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| Jar   | 0.5    | 4      |
| Brick | 2      | 5      |
| Cloth | 0.4    | 3      |

How did the table go? Is it ugly? Should I ~~delete~~ it?

## A Directory Structure

Here's a `pre` which neatly illustrates a directory structure:

```
/ [root]
â”œâ”€â”€ .git
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ typescript  < -- (you must at least have installed typescript)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Or wait... Did it become a `code`?...

## Here's a Picture

...of a cool droplet ðŸ˜²

That's it! I don't think there's any other Markdown syntax we need to cover!
